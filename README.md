# Price tag detection for computer vision applications
#### This is a repository containing a case study and usage examples of YOLOv8 for object detection and tracking. The focus of the study is on the detection of price tags in Brazilian supermarkets. Please note that we have provided a very small sample dataset here for illustrative purposes. It is not recommended to keep data in the same Git remote storage. Instead, consider using solutions like [dvc](https://dvc.org/), [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/), or equivalent for this purpose.

## Result:

The code contains usefull methods to manipulate image data, from raw processing to model training and testing the main steps are covered.
Data was annotated using [label-studio](https://labelstud.io/), the exported format used was YOLO and the `transform_train_test_split` script will format the data according to YOLOV8 and also perform a train/test split.
