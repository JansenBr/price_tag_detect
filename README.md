The code contains usefull methods to manipulate image data, from raw processing to model training and testing the main steps are covered.
Data was annotated using [label-studio](https://labelstud.io/), the exported format used was YOLO and the `transform_train_test_split` script will format the data according to YOLOV8 and also perform a train/test split.
